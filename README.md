A Journey Through Renesas Synergy Code Base

Use this code at your own risk!

Remember, this is not intended to be production code...far from it. It is (usually) the absolute minimum amount of code 
necessary to get a particluar feature/function to work. There is little (if any) error checking, paramater checking,
protection aginst infinite loops, and all those other nasty things that tend to cause problems.

If you don't like this, then don't use the code! :)

Comments are always welcome!
